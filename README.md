# My Battleships game!
This is a logical game written mainly in python language. A short yet very interesting game can be played in Heroku mock terminal.

## How to play.
It is a mini single-player game more similar like Battleship Solitaire game. In this game player guess a computer's battleship and shot it down.
It is program in

The Battleships game is played on grids. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player, (In my game it is a computer ship hidden from players) Players call shots at the computer's fleet, and the objective of the game is to destroy the computer's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer and it has a set grid size and also it warns the user if his guess if off-grid

Here are the images for test case of this game!

This site is created with help of the following coding languages;

### python

although the other languages files are there in the template but the only focus was python.




## Bugs and unfixed bugs

1-when I created all functions I forgot to call the relevant global variable within it and that cause not displaying grid.
2-forgot to add values within functions for col and rows.
3-incorrect indentatin in function which causes trouble in printing out to terminal.
4-Extra spaces which the all functions, blank white spaces, etc.


### Unfix bugs

This project has been completed in 3 days and because of a very short time there are the unfix bugs which I couldn't resolve:

1- over coding: to explain everything precisely and avoid leaving loopholes in the short time I ended up having too much in this game.

the reason I plan to start a two-player game with a bigger board and spend time debugging my code.

2- Some bugs remain unsolved and need a review which causes the site to crash where the user needs to run again.

### Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku
